GitBook has paid plans both for individuals and teams (see [our pricing](https://legacy.gitbook.com/pricing)).

If you are creating content for your company or a team, consider creating and organization and opting for a paid **Organization** plan. Opt for an Individual plan if you don't plan on having any collaborators.
