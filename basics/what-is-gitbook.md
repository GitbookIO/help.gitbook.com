The legacy GitBook is both an [online platform](https://legacy.gitbook.com) for writing and hosting documentation, and an open source [book format and toolchain](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook).

Hundreds of thousands of users use GitBook to write documentation \(library, API, tools, etc.\), or knowledge bases \(like this F.A.Q.\). People also use GitBook to publish technical books, teaching material, and many other things.
