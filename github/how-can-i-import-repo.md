If you started writing your book on GitHub and now want to create a book using
this repository, simply go to the [new book page](https://www.gitbook.com/new) and
select the **GitHub** template on the left.

If you have not already setup GitHub, you will be asked to install our GitHub integration
and come back.

Once this is done, fill in the title and the optional description and select
which GitHub repository you would like to link this new book to.

Finally, click on the **Create book** button.
