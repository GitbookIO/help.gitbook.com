If you started writing your book on GitHub and you now want to create a book
from this repository, you can do so using this [page](https://www.gitbook.com/new).

1. Below the three default templates, click on the arrow down and choose **GitHub**.
2. If you didn't already setup GitHub, you will be asked to install the
   integration and come back. Otherwise, fill in a title and an optional
   description while choosing a GitHub repository to link to this new book.
3. Click on the **Create book** button.
