To import a book from, or link a book to a GitHub repository belonging to a GitHub organization, the GitHub organization needs to grant access to the GitBook application. Otherwise, the repository will not be listed for you to import.

### Check the current status

You can check that GitBook.com is able to access the required GitHub organization by visiting [GitBook's authorization page](https://github.com/settings/connections/applications/e103ee3796d447fab74c).

### Grant access to GitBook

If the GitBook application doesn't have access to the GitHub organization, you can either:
- directly grant the application access to the organization if you are an owner
- or make a request to the organization's owner to grant the access

### Reconnecting your GitHub account

After the access has been granted on GitHub, you must update your GitHub Access Token for GitBook.com.
To do so, simply go to [your settings page](https://www.gitbook.com/settings), click on `Reconnect GitHub Account`
with access to your public (and private if needed) repositories.
