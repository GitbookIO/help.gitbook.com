If you can't find your GitHub repository when trying to link to or create a book from GitHub, you either [did not grant access to this repository](#github-configuration) to our GitHub integration or you are trying to link your book to a [repository that belongs to a GitHub organization](#organizations-repositories).

### Configure GitBook repository access {#github-configuration}

To configure the GitBook permissions to your GitHub repositories, you need to go to the **Installed integrations** GitHub settings for the account that owns the repository and click on the **GitBook** integration.

If you did not select **All repositories** and don't see the repository you are looking for in the _Repository access_ section, you can easily add it to the list of your accessible repositories.
